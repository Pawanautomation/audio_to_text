welcome in everybody we're diving into accessibility testing today and i'm you know i've been looking over these get have resources you said oh yeah it's a really cool max like real projects you know and then those mark interviews for that consultant role plus a bunch of practical tips in a be fun to unpack at all it's quite a collection lots to talk about so right away one thing that jumped out at me was how many projects were all about accessibility and education and yeah like tons of stuff on university where besides and those online learning platforms wedding that us who i think education is one of those areas where accessibility is like a legal thing you know oh right why not just like a good idea exactly it's gotta be there so these projects are showing how important it is to make those tools work for every student i see specially students using assistive technology so it's not just making things look nicer easy to you right it's way more than that it's about giving everybody the same access to the information exactly why i imagine year student who can't see and you trying to sign up for classes oh wow you have trouble moving and you're stuck using just the keyboard to get around the website that would be so frustrating exactly and that's what these projects are all about making sure things actually work i say like you know the test to see if you can sign up for classes using only the keyboard oh interesting or of the screen reader an hour says when your grades get updated or even if you can download pdf yeah yeah pdf sir a whole other thing i could be a real mess he said string leaders have to announce when grades or up that sounds hard how do they even test that so think about it a professor low blows the grades right to the portal right but someone using screen reader they need to know that happened they can't see it i get it so the testing make sure the website tells the assistive tech that something's changed makes sense so it's not just about what you see it's about making those changes you know audible to exact levels interview questions you found those sound intense oh yeah what kind of stuff to they throw at someone who wants to be and accessibility testing consultant what one that was really interesting involved this developer who decided to make their own custom drop down menu ah seems simple right i guess but i bet it causes a ton of accessibility problems oh yeah like a normal drop down menu probably has all that stuff built in already right yeah usually yeah but when you build a custom one year to think about everything wow so the consultant has to consider how someone who can only use a keyboard is gonna get through that menu make sense will screen readers even announcer correctly like trap them in the men you don't know and then there's a or a a labels oh boy and outweigh explain a or i labels for those of us who aren't like coding geniuses think of them as instructions for the assist of tech they were giving extra information that you can't see just by looking at the website so like telling the screen reader how to understand something that's custom made yeah exactly like with a drop down menu a or i a labels would tell the screen reader you know with the menu does how to use it with it oh i see em the consultant has to make sure those labels are done perfectly all right because if they're wrong i could make things worse he exactly know you mentioned w cag a few times what is that exactly and why is it so important for accessibility testing so w keg stands for way web content accessibility guidelines okay they're basically like the rules for making website work for people with disabilities i get it so it's not just good intentions there their actual guidelines yeah w k two point one is the newest one and it has new stuff specifically for mobile accessibility and cognitive disabilities to cool so it's not a ones ice fits all thing though definitely not and in lots of industries like education and online stores falling w keg is a legal requirement really yep it's the law says they mess up they could get in trouble yet big time you even found some cases where companies got sued because their website or an accessible oh wow zachary that's why these guidelines are some and i remember one of those guidelines was about color contrast him it's crazy how something that seems so small can make a huge difference it's true like of the colors are too similar it can be almost impossible for people with low vision to read the text oh right and that's a really common mistake the developers make so these guidelines are there to catch those little things that could have a big it back okay let's talk techno right your research mentioned a bunch of automated testing tools yeah what are some of the good ones that people use for accessibility testing whether a lot but a popular one is acts dev tools okay it works right in your browser and can scan a website really fast to find those communist choose like missing old text on images or none of color contrast also it's like spell check for accessibility yeah kind of letters those little things that are easy to miss awesome so they saved developers a lotta time definitely yeah but there are perfect i was just going to ask that they can't catch everything can they know they're good at finding obvious stuff but they don't really understand the context or a house one might actually use the website oh i say that were manual testing comes in so even with all this fancy technology we still need humans absolutely manual testing takes more time but it's super important for seeing how usable the website really is make sense your research mentioned a couple methods like testing with just the keyboard to see what it's like for people who can't use a mouse and then there's testing the screen readers like your job us and and v d a race you can see what late for people who can't see the screen exactly it's about understanding the experience from different perspectives it sounds like you need a lot of empathy for the sky work you really do you have to be able to put yourself in someone elses shoes icy so the best approach is to use both automated tools and manual testing definitely and even better is if you can test with real users who have disabilities oh that's a good idea because they can give you feedback that you wouldn't get any other way now another thing i came up in your research with continuous improvement in it's not just about fixing things once and then forgetting about it right no excess abilities never really done i guess it's a process you're always try to make things better your research mentioned some strategies like including accessibility checks in the see i see the pipeline moon know what is that exactly it's about building accessibility into every step of the development process got it so instead of fixing things later you're thinking about it from the very beginning right and the even talked about making accessible compose it's you can reuse and different projects all a smart it's way more efficient now and it's better for everyone that makes a lot of science and i bet it saves time and money in the long run it definitely does that being pro active instead of reactive exactly and that's just one of the benefits of this kind of approach to accessibility it's kind of like you know how agile as so popular now yeah this continuous improvement idea fits in perfectly with that it's all about you know it iterative rating getting feedback and making the product better all the time it really does and the tools reflect that you know that integrating those checks right into the sea ice edi pipeline using things like jenkins it's all about making accessibility just part of how things work so it's not like a separate thing you do later new it's built in from day one like that and everybody wins right yeah for sure developers get feedback earlier testers can focus on the trickier problems and in the end the product is better for everyone awesome now back to those interview questions okay were there any of that were like really tough or that made you think one was about testing web sites that have constantly changing content oh like a new say exactly with a live feeds of headlines that are always updating right that's gonna be hard for accessibility yeah how do you make sure someone using a screen reader knows what's happening that's what i was thinking that's exactly what the question was how do you make those updates no clear and not annoying rat and the answer is a are i live regions are you mention those before what are they exactly okay so imagine your coding a website and you can use special a are a code to mark certain parts as live regions okay these are the parts for the content is going to change a lot ice and by doing that you're basically to killing the screen reader hey pay attention to this this is gonna be like a notification system just for screenwriters that's a good way to think about it and when something in that live region changes the screen is your nose and it announces the update that's pretty cool yeah they make sure that people who can't see those changes still know was going on i get it but i bet it's hard to get those live regions right it does take some work like he had to make sure the announcements are clear in short but not too repetitive you know too many would drive me crazy right a bad live region can be just as bad as no updates at all that's a good points like even when you're trying to make things accessible you got a test it and make sure it's actually helpful exactly there's something else i noticed was all the different types of disability they talked about in those scenarios it's not just one thing you're testing for ran away disability a huge spectrum right and people experience the digital world and all sorts of ways right like someone who can't see is going to the different things than someone with a cognitive disability right can you give me some examples of how the testing would change shirt so for someone with a visual impair mid you'd really focus on making sure the screen reader works well right that is good color contrast and that didn't get around the website using just the keyboard okay what about someone with a cognitive disability denude focus more on using really clear language keeping the layout simple and making sure there's not too much informational at one it's gotta it's all about figuring out the challenges the each disability might have and then testing for those specific things that make sense so empathy is really important here absolutely we are you have to put yourself in their shoes and see the world how they see it and sometimes the best way to do that is to actually involve people with disabilities and the test go for sure yeah getting for from real users is the best know one thing i noticed going to your research was that accessibility testing isn't just for web sites it's for mobile apps pdf so even physical spaces it's everywhere why as well making all those environments both online in the real world you know inclusive for everyone so the basic ideas are the same right but the testing is different depending on what you're testing jagger like for a mobile app you might check the size of those buttons and things you tap oh yeah to make sure that easy to hit rate and if it works with voice control or screen reader what about pts for pdf you wanna make sure he reads in the right order that the pictures have those old text descriptions right and that's all coded correctly yeah so assistive technology can understand it it seems like accessibility testing is always changing oh really yeah yeah analogy changes all the time and were always learning more about disability and accessibility right so the ways we test or always evolving to thought to keep up with that is but it's exciting to this has been super interesting i definitely want to learn more do you have any advice on where to start well the debris three see website is a good place a get that's where the published the wc keg guidelines they have tons of information on all of this crate and what about specific tools if you want to try automated testing acts dev tools is a good one okay it's free and it works and most browsers then for manual testing envied yea is a popular screen reader it's free and open source awesome thanks for the tips we've covered so much today from wk to automated testing and even the business side of things yeah it's been a good overview but before we wrap up what's the one thing you really want people to take away from this i think the most important thing thing is that accessibility is about people it's not just a technical problem it's about understanding what different people need and designing with that in mind it's about making sure everyone can use the internet exactly no matter what it's cool how you know people in tech can really put for this or yep it's not just about having like a separate accessibility team it's about making it part of everything abs salute lee your research really highlighted that have like developers thinking about it right away designers making sure things look good for every one right project managers giving people the time and resources to test it it changes the whole culture so it's everybody's job not just something you worry about later exactly yeah and it starts with people who care yeah no yeah people who are passionate about it and who teach their teammates and you know push for it every step of the way and not just their own team right right it spreads to other departments to the bosses yeah it's like this ripple effect were subtly the whole company cares about accessibility i know one thing we haven't really talked about is the business side of that isn't it's not just the right thing to do ethically it's good for business to absolutely in fact one of the things you set me was a job description for and accessibility testing consultant oh yeah and the salary was over sixty thousand pow wow that's a lot it is and think about it when you make things accessible you're opening up to way more customers right the disability communities huge and if you ignore them you're losing money and of course is the legal stuff to oh yeah companies don't want to get sued nobody wants that it's expensive it it makes you look bad so it's not just ethical it's smart business is both it's a win win for everyone this whole deep dive has been amazing it has we've covered so much from the basics of testing to why it's good for business and it's clear that this field is always changing it definitely is black and hopefully this made you think about you know how you could make things more accessible for share one thing that really stuck with me it was this idea of changing how we think about it instead of seeing it as a chore or something extra we can see it as a way to make things better for everyone i like that it's about challenging ourselves and asking you know who might be left out and it actually do ng something about it so as we wrap up here is a challenge for everyone listening think about the web sites and apps to use every day or the accessible to everyone if not what can you do to change that may be share an article with your team suggest inaccessibility audit or just say something when you see a problem good ideas even small things can me a difference absolutely and remember there's help out there the derby three see website the web accessibility initiative all sorts of people wanna make technology work for everyone this has been so interesting thanks for joining me today i pleasure and to everyone listening thanks for joining us for this deep dive into accessibility testing we hope you learn something new and keep learn being keep pushing for change and let's make the internet a better place for everyone
