# Guide: Converting Audio to Text Using OpenAI Whisper

This guide provides detailed steps for installing FFmpeg and Whisper, and converting an audio file to text using Whisper. The output will be stored in a file.

## 1. Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required to process the audio files. Follow these steps to install FFmpeg on Windows.

### Step 1.1: Download FFmpeg

1. Go to [FFmpeg official site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Under **Windows EXE Files**, select **Windows builds from gyan.dev**.
3. Scroll down and download either the **essentials** or **full** build (e.g., `ffmpeg-git-full.7z`).
4. Extract the `.7z` file using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

### Step 1.2: Add FFmpeg to System PATH

1. Open **Start** and search for **Environment Variables**.
2. Click on **Edit the system environment variables**.
3. In the **System Properties** window, click **Environment Variables**.
4. Under **System Variables**, select the **Path** variable and click **Edit**.
5. Click **New**, then paste the path to the **`bin`** folder of the extracted FFmpeg files (e.g., `C:\path\to\ffmpeg\bin`).
6. Click **OK** to save the changes.
7. Open a new **Command Prompt** window and type:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
   If FFmpeg is correctly installed, you should see version details.

## 2. Install OpenAI Whisper

Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI. Here's how to install and use it.

### Step 2.1: Install Python

Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2.2: Install Whisper

Open **Command Prompt** and run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
```

### Step 2.3: Install FFmpeg (if not done already)

Whisper requires FFmpeg to handle audio files. If you haven't installed it yet, install it with:
```bash
pip install ffmpeg-python
```

Alternatively, make sure FFmpeg is correctly installed and available in the system PATH.

## 3. Convert Audio to Text Using Whisper

### Step 3.1: Create a Python Script

Create a new Python file, e.g., `audio_to_text.py`, with the following content:

```python
import whisper
import os

# Path to your audio file
audio_file = "path_to_your_audio_file.mp3"

# Load Whisper model
model = whisper.load_model("small")

# Transcribe audio to text
result = model.transcribe(audio_file)

# Save the transcription to a text file
output_folder = "transcriptions"
os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)  # Create the folder if it doesn't exist
output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, "transcription.txt")

with open(output_file, "w") as f:
    f.write(result["text"])

print(f"Transcription completed. The result is saved in {output_file}")
```

### Step 3.2: Run the Script

1. Replace `"path_to_your_audio_file.mp3"` with the path to your actual MP3 file.
2. Open **Command Prompt** in the directory where the Python script is saved.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python audio_to_text.py
   ```

After running the script, the transcription will be saved in a folder called **`transcriptions`** as a file named **`transcription.txt`**.

## 4. Verify Output

Once the script finishes running, navigate to the **`transcriptions`** folder, and you'll find a file named **`transcription.txt`** containing the converted text from your audio file.

---

### Example of Command Line Execution:

```bash
python audio_to_text.py
```

### Output:

```
Transcription completed. The result is saved in transcriptions/transcription.txt
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you and your team can easily convert audio files to text using OpenAI's Whisper model and FFmpeg. The transcription will be saved in a text file for further use.
```

### Key Notes:
- Replace `"path_to_your_audio_file.mp3"` with the actual path to your audio file.
- The transcription will be saved in the **`transcriptions`** folder as **`transcription.txt`**.

Feel free to modify this as needed for your team. Let me know if you need further clarification!
