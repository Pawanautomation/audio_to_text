 Welcome back everyone. We're diving deep into GraphQL this time. Sounds exciting. It is, you sent us some interesting sources. Yeah. Yeah, a technical talk, some YouTube tutorials for beginners. Oh, and an article. Okay, aiming for a well-rounded understanding then. It seems like it. So where should we start with this? Maybe with the problem Facebook was trying to solve back in 2012. Okay, yeah. They had, well, they were having performance problems. With their mobile app. Their mobile app, it relied heavily on REST APIs. For fetching data. Exactly. Yeah. Like posts, comments, all that. And it was causing a bottleneck. Because each piece of data needed a separate API call. Yeah, it was. It was over fetching. Getting way more data than the app actually needed. Oh, I see. Or sometimes the opposite, under fetching. So even more API calls. Yeah, exactly. And all that back and forth, it was really hurting performance. Yeah. Especially on mobile networks. Makes sense. Definitely been there waiting for an app to load. Frustrating. Definitely. So how did GraphQL fix this? Well, it changes things. Instead of all those trips to the server, GraphQL lets you get exactly what you need. In a single request. In one request. Okay. So tell me how that actually works. Sure. It starts with schemas and types. Think of it as defining the structure of your API data. Like a blueprint. Yeah, kind of like that. So you're defining the data points and their relationships. Like creating tables in a database. Yes. But it's more flexible and expressive. GraphQL schemas, they go beyond simple tables. They can model complex relationships. Oh, interesting. So once the scheme is defined, how do you fetch the data? Well, that's where queries come in. You write queries that specify what you need. So it's like a SQL select T statement. Yes. But for your API, you ask for specific fields and relationships. And the server responds with exactly that. No more, no less. No more digging through irrelevant data. I like it. I saw some simple query examples in those YouTube tutorials, but the conference talk had some pretty complex ones too. What else can you do with those queries? Well, you can traverse relationships between types. Filter data, sort it. You can even do aggregations. It's like having a mini database query language right there in your API requests. That level of control must be really useful for developers. Especially those working with complex data. It is. And GraphQL doesn't just fetch data, you know? Right. What if you need to modify data on the server? That's where mutations come in. Yeah, the YouTube tutorials mentioned mutations. Yeah, they handle changes. It's like the equivalent of post-put D, delete and rest. Okay. But instead of different endpoints, mutations are sent through that same single endpoint. So you can read and modify data all through one endpoint. Yes, you can. That's pretty different from REST APIs. It is. And it's a big part of why GraphQL is getting popular. But wait, there's more. GraphQL also offers subscriptions. Subscriptions, what are those? Imagine you're building a real-time app. Like a chat app or a talk ticker. Okay. With subscriptions, clients can subscribe to changes on the server. And get updates in real time. Yeah. Whenever those changes happen, it's a constant stream of information. Wow, that's powerful. Push notifications on steroids. Exactly. And all of this, the queries, mutations, subscriptions, all through that single endpoint. It's very efficient. It is. Okay, so I've got the single endpoint, the queries. What about resolvers? How do those fit in? Resolvers are key. They're the bridge between your queries and your data sources. Think of them as functions that fetch the data requested in a query. So if I ask for, let's say, the title and author of a book. The resolver figures out how to get that from the database. And whatever database. Any data source, really. SQL, no SQL, even third-party APIs. They handle fetching the data and transforming it into the right format. I see. The conference talk had a demo showing that. It really made it click for me. Seeing that simple query trigger the resolver to fetch the data. Right, it's pretty cool. Yeah, it is. So you're composing these queries and describe the data and the resolvers go get it. All managed by the GraphQL server. Precisely. It's definitely a different way of thinking about APIs. It is. And it sounds like there are some real advantages to GraphQL. There are. We can dive into those next. So we've seen the GraphQL has a different approach. Yeah. Why are developers choosing it? Well, the sources mentioned speed a lot. Speed's a big one. Remember those performance issues Facebook had? If REST APIs, yeah. GraphQL tackles those head-on, no more over-fetching and under-fetching, reduces the number of API calls. So faster load times. Faster load times. Smooter user experience, especially for mobile. That makes sense. Especially as apps get more and more data heavy. Right. And just speed. GraphQL is also flexible. OK. With REST APIs, you're stuck with those fixed endpoints. Yeah. But GraphQL lets clients ask for exactly what they need in the shape they need it. So front-end developers can tailor those data requests. Exactly. And it also changes how GraphQL handles changes. Remember mutations. Yeah. With GraphQL, you can group multiple mutations into one request. It's easier updates. Much easier. No more back and forth with the server. And here's another benefit. GraphQL is self-documenting. Oh. The schema, it's like living documentation. You don't need separate documentation. Nope. It's built right in. Tools like GraphQL Playground, they use the schema for interactive documentation and auto-completion. That's handy. Makes it easy to understand. And what about versioning? That's a pain with REST. That's another win for GraphQL. With REST, you get all these versions. To support different clients. Yeah. A real maintenance nightmare. I can imagine. But with GraphQL, you just add new fields and types to the schema. No breaking changes. So no need for versioning. Exactly. Simplifies things a lot. GraphQL does seem powerful. But what about testing? Testing is super important. And your source has had good info on that. Remember, with GraphQL, you're not testing endpoints. Right. It's queries, mutations, and those resolvers. The YouTube tutorials used postman for testing. Yeah. And the article went deeper. So what are the key things to remember when testing GraphQL? First, schema testing. Got to make sure that blueprint is solid. Makes sense. Then query testing. Send queries and check the responses. Make sure they have the right data. And the conference talk emphasized testing resolvers. Right. Because they're fetching the data. You got to make sure they're doing it right. And transforming it into the right format. Exactly. Often involves mocking data sources to test different situations. The article mentioned just an easy GraphQL for that. Yeah. There are tools specifically for GraphQL testing. And mutations, they need testing too. To make sure the data changes correctly. Absolutely. New records, updates, deletions. Got to be sure it all works as expected. What about errors? How does GraphQL deal with those? Good question. Unlike REST, which uses status codes, GraphQL has a field in the response just for errors. Oh, interesting. So even if the request works, you might get error messages. Makes it easier to handle them. Much easier. And you have to test for those errors too. Make sure the API handles bad queries gracefully. And unauthorized access, stuff like that. Exactly. The article had some good examples of how to simulate those errors. It sounds like testing GraphQL is similar to REST, but with some key differences. Yeah. You got to adapt to that query-based system. All right. So we've covered a lot of ground with GraphQL. We have. Now let's see how it's being used in the real world. So let's GraphQL in action. Where's it making a difference? Yeah. Let's get practical. Well, think about apps where performance is key. OK. Mobile apps like Instagram, Airbnb, they all use GraphQL for those smooth, responsive experiences. Because the app only fetches the data it needs for each screen. Exactly. No wasted bandwidth or processing power. Crucial for mobile, where networks can be unreliable. Yeah. And the talk also highlighted microservices. Oh, yeah. GraphQL in microservices architecture. Tell me more about that. So microservices break down apps into smaller services. Each with its own database and API. Right. Like a team of specialists. Makes sense. But how do they all talk to each other? That's where GraphQL comes in. It's like a central hub. For all the services. Yeah. A single point of entry for clients to get data. Instead of calling each service separately. Exactly. One call to GraphQL and you get everything you need. Much simpler for developers. It is. And big companies like Netflix and Shopify are using it for their platforms. Wow. So we've got mobile apps, microservices. Anywhere else GraphQL is making waves. The article mentioned API-first development. API-first. Yeah. You design the API-first with GraphQL. It's like a contract for how data will be exchanged. Before you write any server-side code. Yeah. Like a blueprint. I get it. This API-first approach with GraphQL really helps teams collaborate and it leads to better APIs. So GraphQL is at the forefront of development these days. It is. It solves performance problems, offers flexibility, makes things more efficient. And it raises a question. Could GraphQL actually become the API standard? That's the big question. It's definitely growing in popularity. But like we talked about, it's not just one replacing the other. Right. Both GraphQL and REST have their strengths. The choice depends on the project. It'll be interesting to see what happens in the future. But knowing GraphQL is definitely important. Absolutely. For anyone building modern apps, yeah. Well, I think we've covered a lot today. We dove into GraphQL, how it works, its benefits, real-world examples, even testing. And we just scratched the surface. You will hear. There's always more to learn. Explore the docs. Play around with GraphQL. See how you can use it. Great advice. Until next time, everyone. Keep diving deep.
