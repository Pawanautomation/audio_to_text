hey everyone and welcome to another deep dive today we're going to be looking at accessibility testing yeah which is super important you know apps for making sure that web sites and apps are usable for every one yeah including people with disabilities fresher we get a whole bunch of cool material to work with the day cool including a yeah a few different simulated in a view questions are it real world examples love that and we're going to be focusing on academy of the insights from senior testers asa about how they approach accessibility testing ends of the challenges that they face i'm excited to see how people think about this media especially those senior people who have been doing it for a while yeah so we're going to try to keep things super practical today in okay so we can be given you guys some actionable insights that you can actually use in your own work that's what i like to hear so one of our sources today actually has this interview question that i think is a great place to start it says as a senior tester how would you conduct accessibility testing would challenges did you face and how to handle that's a great question yeah i think it's a great question to get started with because he really gets at the heart of what we're trying to understand for sure to move we can start their yeah absolutely i'm yeah to get your take on that why i think for me the biggest thing is approaching accessibility testing with the understanding that it really mirrors a lot of other types of testing oh okay interest yeah we talk about software testing and alec will how is it different for accessibility testing it's really not yeah you're still gonna be using that blend of automated and manual testing okay so as now i just as good at it and forget it kind of deal not at all gotcha you know each method has it's own strengths and weaknesses yeah and using them together is what gives us a complete picture of how accessible a platform as gutter and actually this source material has some really great real world examples cool of projects like that illustrate this point oh awesome i'm like for example we've got a university website called unicorn current we've got a university web portal back and then an ecommerce site called ie mart who he marts that's right online shopping that a yes that's a great example absolutely you've got like all the product images and descriptions and then the whole checkout process all the things so many things to consider yeah and think about all the different types of users that might be trying to use the thanks to yeah you know someone might be using a screen reader because they have a visual impairment right or maybe someone's navigating with just a keyboard because of a motor disability right accessibility testing really aims to make sure that everyone regardless of their ability year has a good experience on these sites that's awesome yeah so let's break down each testing type okay let's start with automated testing charlie to deal with that so automated testing is really your first line of defense think of it like a spell checker for your code okay you know it catches those common coding errors yeah quickly and efficiently especially on large scale projects where you've got some me you're more popular tools like acts dev tools yeah wavy ie lighthouse and pal and way and her and sometimes even got custom scripts for some very specific and oh wow yeah you can get pretty yeah i can get pretty on place in depth especially when you're dealing with yeah very nice thing yeah i'm that the beauty of automated testing is that it can analyze a ton of page does very quickly yeah and you'd be surprised how many critical accessibility heirs can actually be hot yeah with a single stand have a website okay cool yeah that saves your developers a lotta time later on down the road to make sense yeah so if it's like a spell checker i'm guessing doesn't catch every single thing exactly yeah it can point out those obvious errors but just like you wouldn't rely on spell check alone to added an entire novel right you can't rely on automated testing alone for accessibility them he said yeah so wind is manual testing come into play so many will testing is crucial because it really digs into the nuances okay of the user experience and that's something that auto me to tools just can't do got here it answers those questions like i can someone using a screen reader actually understand what's happening on this page oh right or can someone navigate the say using only a keyboard wow things like that i never really thought about navigating a website without a mouse before yeah the whole other way world so what are some the key things that you focus on during manual testing one of the first things i always do is meticulously go through the entire website using just keyboard commands or was so you know using things like the tab key and the enter key here and i ask myself can i access every single button link and form field oh and does the tab order make sense you know does it follow a logical path through the page touch up and it's really interesting because it forces you to experience the website you're in a completely different way that's fascinating yeah at it really makes you realize yeah like how many assumptions we make sure we're we're design these website absolutely okay cool so wales is involved in manual testing another critical area is screen reader testing okay so we use software like jade of us and vitiello and voiceover okay and these programs basically read the web sites code here and present the information through audio cues wow so it it's essentially semi leading how a user who is blind or visually impaired right would experience the site wow so you're socially like listening to the website that's right instead of seeing it yeah what sorts of things you listening for so we're listening to make sure that things like form labels an error messages are announced clearly by the screen reader you know can the user understand the purpose of each form field just by listening to it okay we're also checking to see how well the screenwriter navigates things like pop ups her and if it correctly interpret a our eye rolls yeah which are essentially attributes who that help assistive technology is understand what different parts of a web page are supposed to do gotcha so it gets pretty technical oh yeah i can imagine yeah it's other you really getting into like the nitty gritty of the code at that point we are well this as yet as ignorant as ability testing is more complex than i yeah he thought it can be a little bit daunting you're good at first for sure but it sounds really interesting it is very interesting yeah and that's just keyboard navigation and screen reader testing or while we also look at things like color contrast right make sure that the text is readable for people with low vision gotcha and then we've got dynamic content testing which make sure that any updates to the page or communicated effectively to those assistive technology it's okay cool yet so you brought up a law degree points yeah but i'm curious what happens when you uncover like a ton of accessibility issues riley how do you decide what to fix first yeah i imagine that could get yeah really overwhelming it absolutely can be a your and honestly the answers not a always straightforward okay because you know we rarely have the time or resources to fix it every single thing at one alright so we have to prioritize soccer and for me it always comes back to use or impact yeah so have to ask myself how badly does this issue affect someone's ability to actually use the website the okay so if it's like per vending someone from yeah do something essential on the website exile be like a top priority that's right would you try to check out an ecommerce site and you can slowly that's a big deal big deal okay yeah those are usually called blockers to access and content or in the should be at the top of your list okay we also consider the frequency and volume of the issue choose so you know if a problem is widespread across the website yeah fixing it's going to have a much broader impact the make sense ah and then there's legal and compliance considerations rajesh can vary depending on the industry and location of the website okay so that's something to keep in mind so many things to keep of by res yeah that's what up to traffic analysis probably comes into play their to write lately if like a particular page is getting a lot of traffic ray it would make more sense to fix the accessibility issues their first the threat you want to prioritize those high traffic area do and then don't forget about what i call quick wins okay which are those relatively easy fixes that can make a big difference beaucoup like what like adding alt text to images all right which is that descriptive tax that helps people who can't see the image understand what it's all about yeah they can have a huge impact yeah sometimes is the simple things like that make the biggest difference absolutely no cool okay so we've got like the severity the issue yep how widespread the issue is a legal ramifications quick fixes yeah what else factors into your prioritization strategy will we also pay close attention to user feedback oh okay though you know what are people telling us to directly about their experience on the site ajit because that direct feedback can be so incredibly valuable in guiding our priority a celtic there's a lot to juggle it's a lot to juggle yeah it's a balancing act for sure cool but at the end of the day the goal is to create a truly inclusive digital world yeah where every one can participate equally i love them and that's something worth striving for for sure yeah okay i think that the group least a pause for known and when we come back we can dive into some of those real world examples heard from the source material am excited i'm really curious to see how does different testing techniques yeah actually play out in practice me too so or or it so let's take a look at birth university web portal project that we mentioned earlier nigger that's a really great example of how this all works in a real world setting yeah i mean universities have so much information online these days so know see you get course catalog student portals financial aid for worms like all kinds of stuff yeah i can imagine that navigating all of that can be a challenge oh for sure even for someone with out accessibility needs absolutely and this particular portal was meant to be like a central hub for students faculty and staff okay so accessibility with absolutely crucial yeah they really wanted to make sure everyone could act us the information and tools that they needed okay so how did the even begin to approach testing for something that complex will the first step was to really understand the scope of the project so they mapped out all the key areas of the portal things like student log in course registration financial aid applications faculty modules for uploading grades wow really anything you could think of okay so it's kind of like reading a road map of the user journey that's a great way to put it okay yeah and once they had that map yeah they needed to figure out what accessibility standards they needed to meet right things like the web content accessibility guidelines you know w k eg okay those are like the international standards for digital accessibility roger eighty eight compliance section five a week guidelines which apply to federal agencies well that's a lot of different guidelines it is yeah i can see why i'm having experienced testers on board would be so important absolutely yeah and it's not just about knowing the guidelines writes about understanding how to apply them via in different contexts okay so for their testing tools did they stick with that kind of automated in man you yeah they do the combination of automated and manual testing tools okay cool so for automated they're using things like acts dev tools wavy he and lighthouse okay and then for the manual testing they had screen readers like jw yes young and video and voiceover along with a color contrast and the wiser so they were really trying to cover all their bases absolutely grow and they made sure to test on a variety of devices and browsers to get legal access web sites from the exactly desktops laptops phone yep all the things have loads everything yeah and it's not just about the device it's about the browser to write chrome firefox safari i'm even different versions of those browsers can have an impact on accessibility that's so interesting i never really thought about that oh yeah it can be a big factor okay so they did their homework yes the figured out which guidelines applied ah they chose their tools out the set of they're testing environment that's right what happened next so the automated testing was their first step back convey they ran tools like acts dev tools on a bunch of key pages them like the log in page student dashboard course catalog registration pages financial aid forms occur and you know what it caught a bunch of common coating errors oh really like we're going to years things like images missing altec ext right we talked about before had have descriptive tax that helps people who can't see the image your understand what it's about you they also found issues with poor color contrast on buttons making it hard to read the tax year and a or i roles that weren't configured correctly okay so is getting those like basic coding mistake less the concrete big accessibility barrier is act later and then they use a tool called wave ie to double check those findings and also to highlight areas that might need manual testing okay things like form fields which require you to input information and the overall navigation of the say are often better evaluated by human tester right because those aspects or bit more nuanced yes than what an automated talk and pick up on exactly okay so what did the manual testing process look like for this project so keyboard navigation was a big focus for them to if they wanted to make sure the website was fully functional using just the keyboard nuclear which is essential for people who can't use a mouse or trackpad yeah so they went through each interaction clicking buttons following links film the out forms all using just the tab key and enter key that says pretty painstaking it can be yeah but it's also incredibly important where they made sure the tab order was logical hook up you know that it followed a clear path through the page or and they also check that those focus indicators the you know those visual cues that show you where you are on the page wrote were actually visible and easy to follow it makes you realize how many little details go into making a website truly accessible it really does yeah it's amazing okay so what about screen reader testing screen reader testing was another big part of this project okay they used g w s and md a on windows computers and then voice voiceover on max how can you know they want to make sure the screen reader experience was smooth and understandable across different platforms wow screen reader testing that sounds it's intense yeah intense yeah what exactly are they listening for so for example when you're navigating a form yeah the screen reader she it announced the labels for each field clearly right otherwise a user who can't see the form wouldn't know what information to enter right of be like filling out a blank sheet of paper exactly okay wow hadn't your pocket that the i can be really tricky yeah and the also tested how the screen reader handle dynamic content okay so imagine you have a pop up yeah yeah the it appears on the screen way that pop up needs to be announced by the screen reader okay other was the user might not even know it's there right that's a great point yeah so they're not just listening to the words being read yeah but how the screen reader interacts with the different elements of the page gotcha and they made sure that the a r i a role java code attributes that we talked about earlier yep we're being interpreted correctly of by the screen readers okay it's all about making sure that the information is presented in a way that makes sense so did they find any specific examples where things were working quite right they did late one one common issue they found and was with missing form labels oh really yeah to so without those labels your screen reader users had no way of knowing what information they were supposed to enter into the form fields oh wow yeah that would be incredibly frustrating it would yeah that's why testing is so important yeah they were able to catch these issues and work with the developers okay to make sure those form label were added in so they didn't just point out the probably why they worked on solutions to okay cool yeah they documented everything they found including screenshots and references to the specific w c can criteria okay that were being violated wow very thorough yeah and they provided clear recommendations to the development team or explaining exactly how to fix the issues so they were real advocates for accessibility yeah not just testers that's the ideal scenario yeah for sure you want testers to be passionate about accessibility and yeah work collaboratively with the development teams all to get these things fixed go cool what about things like color contrast yet so they did find some issues there go they used a color contrast analyzer to make sure the text and background colors had enough contrast stucco which is really important for people with low vision yeah and in a few instances the contrast wasn't sufficient or though they recommended color changes to the developer team so by the end of this whole process yeah you were able to address all of those accessibility issues pretty much yeah after the development team implemented those fixes yeah they did regression testing burger which essentially means they retested everything right to make sure those fixes didn't accidently introduce any new excessive melody probably right you don't wanna fix one problem and create another one exactly and in the end they were able to get that university portal to meet the wc cag two point one level a requirements it's awesome it was a huge accomplishment yeah i bet it made a big difference for the students and faculty and staff who rely on assistive technology geez it did that's great yeah they got a lot of positive feedback from user saying how much easier it was to use the portal cool and from a legal standpoint the university was able to reduce their risk of lawsuits right by demonstrating their commitment to accessibility those really like a win win situation it is good for the users yeah and good for the organization absolutely okay awesome i'm so let's switch gears a bit and talk about that he comres website you mark i'm this project highlights how the same principles of accessibility testing could be applied yes to a completely different type of website totally different okay i'm excited to dive into the world of online shopping read soon and see what they did to make emerge accessible for everyone let's do it okay so he mart online shopping yes huge boy of our lives these days absolute is super important that these sites are accessible for sure for everyone it really is and in this project there are really focused on achieving that wt cag two point one level a compliance okay for both the desktop and mobile versions of the ie mart website that make sense people are jumping on their phones all the time more than ever her yeah so did the approach testing differently for mobile vs desktop so the core principles where the same poker but they definitely had to consider the unique challenges at each platform okay so on mobile for example you have to think about things like screen size ray and touch targets you know can someone with limited dexterity easily tap those buttons oh that's a good point yeah and consider that as big one so how do these structure the overall testing process for emerge so they followed a very similar process as though to the university portal project okay they started by identifying or the key areas of the website the you know the home page the product search functionality yeah the individual product pages the shopping cart and of course the checkout process okay so that familiar map out the user journey up the three are we noticing any patterns here definitely a systematic approach is key yeah for any accessibility testing project okay cool and speaking of patterns they used a lot of the same tools as the university project okay so things like acts dev tools for automated testing ogre and then a variety of screen readers yeah for the manual testing tools for testing keyboard navigation wrote and a color contrast analyzer okay so good mix of automated emanuel test he got it was like we've been discussing exactly and just like in the university project the automated testing quickly flagged of yeah some common problems here so acts dev tools found things like i missing a r eye rolls right images without alt text elements with insufficient color contrast it seems like there's a theme emerging here you're catching on yeah but the manual testing is where things get really interesting you know they really dug deep into how users actually experience the website for so they went through every single interaction on the site using just their keyboard while making sure those focus indicators were clearly visible and that the tab order made logical sense that so important it is you have to make sure that someone who can't use a mouse can still access everything's always and then of course came the screen reader testing see survey a went through those he workflows ogre you know searching for products adding items to the car yeah i'm pleading the checkout process all while listening to how the screen reader announced that information i'm curious what are some of the things that are particularly tricky to test for accessibility yeah on an ecommerce site like emerge dynamic content is always a challenge go you've got things like those product carousel get at rotate through images right or those pop ups that appear when you add something to your cart yeah you have to make sure that those updates are being communicated right to assistive technology is effectively yeah a screen reader user needs to know that something has been added to their cart exactly even if they can't visually see it for sure and another tricky area is form accessibility okay think about those check out forums where you enter your payment and shipping information right they have to be properly labeled said that a screen reader a user knows what information goes in each field and on those error messages right like if you enter an invalid credit card number they need to be clear and informative yeah and then you also have to make sure that the forms are navigable using just keyboard oh my gosh i could imagine if those forms are accessible by america would be neighbor it would yeah but anymore it's case they were really thorough and they're testing ogre and they worked closely with the developers to fix any issues that they found kool aid documented everything offered solutions and did that regression testing right to make sure the fixes didn't break anything else okay so what was the end result of all this testing so the ema website met the w c keg two point one level a standards awesome which was a huge when yeah for them and their customers that's fantastic yeah not only did they improve the usability for people with disabilities yeah but they also made the site better for everyone right clearer navigation better error messages yeah these are things that benefit all users it's amazing how those accessibility improvements all no often just have like a ripple effect and make the web a better place for every one that's where my favorite things about accessibility work it's about inclusivity yeah but it's also about creating better digital experiences i love that yeah i guess a perfect know to and on i agree so for you or listener we hope this deep dive into accessibility testing has given you a better understanding of what it takes to create a truly inclusive digital world absolutely we've explored the why of accessibility and why it matters and the impact it has on real people for sure we dug into the different types of testing from those automated checks to those in depth may your reviews yep and we've seen how these techniques actually play out in real world scenarios and if you want to learn more yeah we encourage you to explore the links and the show notes absolutely there are some great race sources out there for anyone who's interested in diving deeper yeah and remember accessibility isn't just about checking boxes or meeting legal requirements right it's about empathy yes it's about putting yourself in the shoes of someone who might experience the web differently than you do absolutely to of you take away one thing from this episode let it be this with that it's accessibility is everyone's responsibility couldn't agree more thanks for joining us on his deep dive into accessibility testing yeah thanks for listening everybody until next time
